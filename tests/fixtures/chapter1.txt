Chapter 1: The Beginning

Alice walked through the ancient doors of the Library, her footsteps echoing in the vast silence. The prophecy had led her here, to this forgotten place where knowledge slept beneath layers of dust.

"You shouldn't be here," a voice said from the shadows.

She turned to find Bob, the keeper of forbidden texts, watching her with wary eyes. His robes were tattered, his beard unkempt, but his gaze was sharp as ever.

"The Tower is awakening," Alice said. "We don't have time for protocols."

Bob's expression shifted from suspicion to alarm. "How do you know about the Tower?"

"Because I've seen it in my dreams. Every night for the past month." She pulled the ancient map from her satchel. "And I know you're the only one who can help me stop what's coming."

The Library groaned around them, as if the very walls were listening. Bob looked up at the towering shelves, centuries of wisdom pressing down on them both.

"Follow me," he said at last. "But understand this—once you learn what's in the Restricted Section, there's no going back."

Alice nodded. She'd known that from the moment the dreams began. There never was any going back.
